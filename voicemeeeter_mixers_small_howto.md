VoiceMeeeter is a **professional** mixing console in software, runs in most win-x flavours.

Because it's a real mixer the connections you can make with it are as versatile as my real mixing consoles in the studio and at home.

The biggest console has a limit of **6hrs** of use, after which it _interrupts_ your audio briefly. **Banana** has a maximum of three hardware inputs, that is more than enough for the average streamer. It even is good enough for me in my SoHo studio, from which I also stream.


Users who need more than three hardware inputs can easily pay the authors via the donationware system that VoiceMeeeter has in place, you basically pay what you can afford.

Just like a real PA mixer needs a _snake_ to connect the stage audio equipment with the mixing console, VoiceMeeeter uses virtual audio cables, of which two can be used along with the **_Banana_** and **Potato** version of the mixer. The two others are also donation-ware.

**Virtual Audio Cable** is the first cable system.

**_HiFi_ Virtual Audio Cable** is the second cable system.

You tell your audio applications to send their output to one of the two snakes.

On your VoiceMeeeter Mixer you patch one multi-channel fader to **_HiFi_ Virtual Audio Cable** and another to **Virtual Audio Cable**

I've mapped one audiosource to **kernel mode** _Virtual Cable_ (2nd hardware fader) and another audio source to **_HiFi_ Virtual Audio Cable** which I patched to the third hardware fader. The first fader has my **Behringer** the digitizer, which converts audio from my Yamaha mixing console to very low-latency HQ digital audio.  

Because these cables are in essence **audio snakes** you can connect as many audio sources as you want to them so the mixer fader then acts as a _group fader_ for all these sources.
A physical mixer has two or more subgroups where you assign the individual channels to a subgroup.
