I started with vi on noisy phone lines for the BBS's of the university.

I was a student then, who had the task to punch holes in the system for the URC director so he could fix them.

THat was in the 1990's.

Vim use then was

- `vi filename.extension`
- `:i`
- enter & correct data
- Get out of interactive mode the moment the line goes bad
- do a `:u` when bad stuff came on the screen
- `:w` in between (I had to do this **very often** since `ATH0` was often send to the Telbit 9600bps modems when the lines went beserk)
- `:wq` at the end when all looked good on the screen 


The power of insert mode saved my sanity on the copper wires I had to edit files over.

For a while this was the only way I used vim. I did not bother with learning others since this was all I needed

Note: I will use the terms **vim** and _vi_ interchangeably. When I talk about the bare version, I reference POSIX vi which you should find on all posix compliant OS'es
