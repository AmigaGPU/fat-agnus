I started with vim on noisy phone lines for the BBS's of the university.

I was a student then who had to punch holes in the system for the URC director so he could fix them.

THat was in the 1990's.

Vim use then was

`vim filename.extension`

`i`

enter data

`:wq`

The power of insert mode saved my sanity on the copper wires I had to edit files over
