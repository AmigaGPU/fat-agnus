Firefox has a nice comeback with their **Quantum** browser. 2x faster engine and a lot of issues resolved. Installing it as a chrome user also means transparent importing of the gazillion UID's I have there.

I have an extensive technical background so finding most extensions an equivalent was easy. THe only one thats hard is #authy, since they make a full program, that only seems to be easy for those coders to do in the chrome external program ENV

THe reason why I left ffox after _decades_ of use is the horrific stranglehold it started to make on CPU cycles. It became unusable on my 2x core desktop in times long back (20 years ago).

When I switched to my Quad Core it worked well for only a few years, then the same BS occured. Firefox would freeze when it only needed to open 4 browser tabs.

I caputulated and went to the dark chrome side.

First thing I knew was to max the ram in the machine since chrome is like a *Ford Mustang* from 1969 when it comes down to wasting fuel.

What a breeze that switch was. THe core load of firefox which was **4x25%!!!** went down to 16% max with chrome! Amazing! Chrome was also much much snappier in everything.

Like the programmers of chrome know that their browser will be used a lot on toaster machines, they made sure it runs very well on low powered CPU's. The moment chrome sees that you have oogles of RAM its like a ballerina in concert!

When google recently had the audacity to announce that they will basically castrate extensions which do adblocking, tried firefox again.

This is after 5+ years of chome peace of mind. I pay dearly with my privacy, I get cross platform ease in return.

This is a _w.i.p_ This doc is not finished, but ripe for publication.
