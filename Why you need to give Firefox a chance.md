Firefox has a nice comeback with their **Quantum** browser. 2x faster engine and a lot of issues resolved. Installing it as a chrome user also means transparent importing of the gazillion UID's I have there.

I have an extensive technical background so finding most extensions an equivalent was easy. THe only one thats hard is #authy, since they make a full program, that only seems to be easy for those coders to do in the chrome external program ENV:(*)

THe reason why I left ffox after _decades_ of use is the horrific stranglehold it started to make on CPU cycles. It became unusable on my 2x core desktop in times long back (20 years ago).

When I switched to my Quad Core it worked well for only a few years, then the same BS occured. Firefox would freeze when it only needed to open 4 browser tabs.

I caputulated and went to the dark chrome side.

First thing I knew was to max the ram in the machine since chrome is like a *Ford Mustang* from 1969 when it comes down to wasting fuel.

What a breeze that switch was. THe core load of firefox which was **4x25%!!!** went down to 16% max with chrome! Amazing! Chrome was also much much snappier in everything.

Like the programmers of chrome know that their browser will be used a lot on toaster machines, they made sure it runs _very well_ on low powered CPU's. The moment chrome sees that you have oogles of RAM its like a ballerina in concert!

When google recently had the audacity to announce that they will basically castrate extensions which do adblocking, I tried firefox again.

This is after 5+ years of chome peace of mind. I pay dearly with my privacy, I get cross platform ease in return.

I use _advanced ad-blocking_ so no one actually bothers me with (un)targetted ads. I do know that google know a **TON** about all who use its most advanced spyware -> chrome

Firefox still uses _**unacceptable ammounts of CPU cycles**_ on my machine with 4 cores modern GPU's (GTX 1050) dual tasking with a dedicated GPU for nVEnc and smaller tasks on a 2nd panel.

You need a certain ammount of juice to run it smoothly, while your machine streams runs the DAW software and does other work.

Chrome runs smoothly on this light CPU with everything else modern and by the times

THis doc was written inspired by this wonderfull post <https://dev.to/dtroode/why-you-need-to-give-firefox-a-chance-5g5a>


(*)
No authy in firefox means losing the powerfull _**multi-device cross-platform**_ capability of that _#MFA_ solution. That is a **no-no**. I need _authy_ to run on all OS's I work in, so chrome, or at least a a chrome(ium) based browser will always be needed here.
I won't sacrifice <http://authy.com> power for anyone or anything.


This is a _w.i.p_ This doc is not finished, but ripe for publication.
