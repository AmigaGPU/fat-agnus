I love how I found the way to IRC cloaking. It started on a tweet from the #freeBSD community, where I saw the term `irc cloak`.
Fascinated I type `irc cloak freenode` in a search engine and got popped with the link <https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/IRC/Cloaks>

When I jumped to the section #Obtaining_a_cloak I got a nice command I could use to access an IRC bot on the freenode network `/msg WmopBot cloak`

The _bot_ presents you with an **#Oauth link* to a proper page where simple instructions need to be followed to be queued.

### These are the requirements to be granted a cloak

* User must have a verified e-mail address (throwaway/disposable emails are not acceptable)
* User must have at least 250 edits on Wikimedia projects
* User must have a Wikimedia project account registered for at least three months
* User must not be actively blocked from a project

In my enthousiasm, I _**immediately**_ asked for the IRC cloak, while I created my account _today_ & now only have a few edits ;)

When I have the 250 edits & my `metawiki` account is mature enough I shall be granted the request eventually


#### Note(*)
I started in _vim_ to see if .md editing is also smooth in **default** vim

It is not, you're better off with a proper .md editor
