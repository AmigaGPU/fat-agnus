I've downloaded firefox **ESR** and am migrating important addons to firefox equivalents. Up to now most of them, apart from _authy_ (a crucial one) have native versions.

One nice thing is that ffox was able to get my passwords _imported transparently_ from my chrome **ENV:**

For me extentions like _uBlock Origin BitWarden_ & _LastPass_ are vital

A last important one was a _tab history_ extension which I found within 4hrs

Now I have to look if the latest incarnations are not as CPU hungry as the ones that forced me to stop in 2013. (*)

If it is good on this ageing #DAW, I have my response to google's FU to us, their users

I noticed in #chrome how an extension with good functionality can cause a **big** spike in CPU loads

An awsome vim extension, which is great to use those keys in chrome & firefox, causes a spike from 16% to 24% max load, which is almost a _**whole core**_ on the machine. The _moment_ I removed it, chrome went back to its _normal_ cpu load curve.

Since ffox still uses too much CPU for my comfort I naturally removed it too. However I'm now check which extensions I can do without, so my firefox installs can run as _lean and mean_ as possible.


(*)
I have to check if this is synced on github too. Nice, this doc is also synced via **github**. This is the link to the latest update in the repository

(**)
The browser still uses **significantly** more _**CPU**_ than chrome in comparison. I will keep it around so that when adblocking from _ublock_ breaks in chrome, I can jump ship without any fuzz
