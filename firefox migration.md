  I've downloaded firefox **ESR** and am migrating important addons to firefox equivalents. Up to now most of them, apart from _authy_ (a crucial one) have native versions!
  
  One nice thing is that ffox was able to get my passwords _imported transparently_ from my chrome **ENV:**
  
  For me extentions like _**uBlock Origin BitWarden**_ & _**LastPass**_ are vital
  
  A last important one was a _**tab history**_ extension which I found within 4hrs
  
  Now I have to look if the latest incarnations are not as CPU hungry as the ones that forced me to stop using it in 2013. (*)
  
  If it is good on this ageing #DAW, I have my response to google's FU to us, their users
  
  I noticed in #chrome how an extension with good functionality can cause a **big** spike in CPU loads
  
  An awsome vim extension, which is great to use those keys in chrome & firefox, causes a spike from 16% to 24% max load, which is almost a _**whole core**_ on the machine. The _moment_ I removed it, chrome went back to its _normal_ cpu load curve.
  
  Since ffox still uses too much CPU for my comfort I naturally removed it too. However I'm now check which extensions I can do without, so my firefox installs can run as _lean and mean_ as possible.
  
  
  (*)
  I have to check if this is synced on github too. Nice, this doc is also synced via **github**. This is the link to the latest update in the repository
  
  (**)
  The browser still uses **significantly** more _**CPU**_ than chrome in comparison. I will keep it around so that when adblocking from _ublock_ breaks in chrome, I can jump ship without any fuzz
