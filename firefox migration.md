Firefox migration
=

I've downloaded firefox **ESR** and am migrating important addons to firefox equivalents. Up to now most of them, apart from _authy_ (a crucial one) have native versions.

One nice thing is that ffox was able to get my passwords _imported transparently_ from my chrome **ENV:**

For me extentions like _uBlock Origin BitWarden_ & _LastPass_ are vital

A last important one was a _tab history_ extension which I found within 12hrs

Now I have to look if the latest incarnations are not as CPU hungry as the ones that forced me to stop in 2013. (*)


If it is good on this ageing #DAW, I have my response to google's FU to us, their users

(*)
The browser still uses **significantly** more _**CPU**_ than chrome in comparison. I will keep it around so that when adblocking from _ublock_ breaks in chrome, I can jump ship without any fuzz
