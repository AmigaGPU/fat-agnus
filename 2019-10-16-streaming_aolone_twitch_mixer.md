### The beginning
Streaming for yourself is quite normal. Many streamers dont even reach affiliation on twitch, even if their quality of audio (IMHO the most important) is great and their video is fair to good

I'm a **SoundEngineer** for me the audio is the most important in a streamers arsenal. Because of the way protocols work, the _audio-channels_ are initialized first then the (**h264** video comes in)

This means that people will usually **hear** first what you stream _then_ see your video frames.

Bad audio means visitors will leave, people are much less tolerant when it comes to audio. That is why it's important to invest in a good audio setup. _Yamaha_ & **Behringer** have equipment suited for small setups.  Don't go for mixers smaller than 16 channels.

My current _16 in 4 in two_ mixer has only 3 channels free because I have not connected the 2nd and third **Shure SM58** mics to the system. Every dual channel device takes up, **two** mixer channels, on my mixer that means that channels 9-16 are permanently full.

I have HQ audio devices which I deliberately connect to channels which have contact with the **_on-board compressor_**, of course through good direct boxes which you can buy from _Behringer_.



This document is a *wip, work in progress* Its not finished yet. It is ripe for (prelimenary) publishing, which is the main reason why I released it.
