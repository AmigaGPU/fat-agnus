## VoiceMeeeter advanced HOWTo for SoHo studio's 
realtime synced(*)

VoiceMeeeter is a **professional** mixing console in software, runs in most win-x flavours.

In this doc I will highlight the usage of **#VBAN** an advanced _UDP_ based network protocol designed to send your audio in broadcast quality (uncompressed PCM format) from mixing console to mixing console and to various #VBAN receptors throughout like phones and client machines running a mixmode of _android iOS_ and win64 OS'es

(**)
_Analog_ in the sence that the effect has true VU-meter behaviour and a well executed behaviour pattern of its analog counterpart, like tube distorters and effects of that nature.

This HowTO is a *wip, work in progress* Its not finished yet. It is ripe for prelimenary publishing, which is the main reason why I released it.
