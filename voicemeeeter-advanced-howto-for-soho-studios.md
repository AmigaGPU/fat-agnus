## VoiceMeeeter advanced HOWTo for SoHo studio's 
realtime synced(*) powered & played by github!

VoiceMeeeter is a **professional** mixing console in software, which runs in most win-x flavours.

In this doc I will highlight the usage of **#VBAN** an advanced _UDP_ based network protocol designed to send your audio in broadcast quality (uncompressed PCM format) from mixing console to mixing console and to various #VBAN receptors throughout like phones and client machines running a mixmode of _android iOS_ and win64 OS'es.

I will cross-scribe the tweets I posted some days ago in this document in a chronological order

#VBAN, The **VB-Audio Network Protocol** is an advanced network protocol to cast your sound over the network in *REAL TIME* to a receptor or another VoiceMeeter mixer. Yes you can network link your mixing consoles!

I have configured **#VBAN** that it sends the audio over my whole network segment. That way all I need 2 do is install a receptor on a machine and viola, my #Yamaha audio is heard there, sent over the #LAN

These are the tweets I organize in a logical sequence

#VBAN is professional grade multichannel audio and can be send in sampling rates to 96 kHZ up to 24 bits resolution up to 8 channels (DTS7.1)in native PCM format on your LAN

The machine which only receives #VBAN does not need to be high spec. The fact that clients have been programmed for phones indicates that reception only puts a light load on the system

#VBAN is such a fascinating subject that I will be playing more with it, since the concept of linking soft mixing consoles via LAN on #DAW's which are mainly linked to hardware mixers like my #Yamaha 16 channel consoles opens up a whole lot of audio control possibilities

I shall also show you, that in case you only use VoiceMeeeter Banana the #VBAN routing is virtually the same, you only have less busses and less hardware channels


I've played extensively with the latest #VoiceMeeeter mixing console & #VBan Network Sound Caster√∞

#VoiceMeeeter enables you to cast your audio over your LAN in different quality modes, so expensive equipment like #Sonos networked speaker systems are not needed. Use the VBan receptors on #win64 #android (and #iOS?) to receive the signal and route it to your speakers.

Instead of pulling XLR cables in your ceiling to your studio monitors, you can pull  one RJ45 cable and use that for casted audio & LAN signals

(**)
_Analog_ in the sence that the effect has true VU-meter behaviour and a well executed behaviour pattern of its analog counterpart, like tube distorters and effects of that nature.

This HowTO is a *wip, work in progress* Its written as you read. It _is_ ripe for (prelimenary) publishing, which is the main reason why I released it.
