## VoiceMeeeter advanced HOWTo for SoHo studio's 
realtime synced(*)

VoiceMeeeter is a **professional** mixing console in software, which runs in most win-x flavours.

In this doc I will highlight the usage of **#VBAN** an advanced _UDP_ based network protocol designed to send your audio in broadcast quality (uncompressed PCM format) from mixing console to mixing console and to various #VBAN receptors throughout like phones and client machines running a mixmode of _android iOS_ and win64 OS'es.

I will cross-scribe the tweets I posted some days ago in this document in a chronological order

#VBAN, The **VB-Audio Network Protocol** is an advanced network protocol to cast your sound over the network in *REAL TIME* to a receptor or another VoiceMeeter mixer. Yes you can network link your mixing consoles!

I have configured **#VBAN** that it sends the audio over my whole network segment. That way all I need 2 do is install a receptor on a machine and viola, my #Yamaha audio is heard there, sent over the #LAN

◆🎧#VBAN is professional grade multichannel audio and can be send in sampling rates to 96 kHZ up to 24 bits resolution up to 8 channels (DTS7.1)in native PCM format on your LAN🎧◆

◆🎧The machine which only receives #VBAN does not need to be high spec. The fact that clients have been programmed for phones indicates that reception only puts a light load on the system🎧◆

◆🎧#VBAN is such a fascinating subject that I will be playing more with it, since the concept of linking soft mixing consoles via LAN on #DAW's which are mainly linked to hardware mixers like my #Yamaha 16 channel consoles opens up a whole lot of audio control possibilities🎧◆

◆🎧I shall also show you, that in case you only use VoiceMeeeter Banana the #VBAN routing is virtually the same, you only have less busses and less hardware channels🎧◆


◆🎧I've played extensively with the latest #VoiceMeeeter mixing console & #VBan Network Sound Caster🎧◆🎶🎵

🎧#VoiceMeeeter enables you to cast your audio over your LAN in different quality modes, so expensive equipment like #Sonos networked speaker systems are not needed. Use the VBan receptors on #win64 #android (and #iOS?) to receive the signal and route it to your speakers!🎧

◆🎧Instead of pulling XLR cables in your ceiling to your studio monitors, you can pull  one RJ45 cable and use that for casted audio & LAN signals🎧◆

(**)
_Analog_ in the sence that the effect has true VU-meter behaviour and a well executed behaviour pattern of its analog counterpart, like tube distorters and effects of that nature.

This HowTO is a *wip, work in progress* Its not finished yet. It is ripe for prelimenary publishing, which is the main reason why I released it.
