I use bash over the whole gamut, from simple tasks as managing files & directories in `~` to (simple) programming & scripting where it is just vital to have a shell you are comfortable in.

There are many flavors of shells, so you will also meet people who love *#csh #ksh #zsh* (had this on my Amiga) *#ash #sh (the original Bourne shell)*

Whatever OS I'm in, I install git, since it also has _git bash_ in case you are on an OS which has no bash installed. 

This is an example of how I use git to manage markdown files all via bash

I can easily move to another workstation and OS. Then I can pickup where I left off transparently as if nothing happened.

I could also sync my ~/.bash_history via my network, if needed instead of ssh-ing to the machine to peek into the file to lookup a complex tunnel pipe I've forgotten the syntax to.

Since I also spawn all executable from the shell ever since the #c64 & #amiga computer era (Amiga CLI), I have a shell open whenever my workstation runs. In case of this #DAW it's 24/7
