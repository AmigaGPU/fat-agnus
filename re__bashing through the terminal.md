I'm an avid _bash_ user. I use _bash_ over the whole gamut, from simple tasks as managing files & directories in `~` to (simple) programming & scripting where it is just *vital* to have a shell you are comfortable in.

There are many flavors of shells, so you will also meet people who love _#csh #ksh #zsh_ (had this on my Amiga) _#ash #sh (the original Bourne shell)_

Whatever OS I'm in, I install git, since it also has _git bash_ in case you are on an OS which has no bash installed. 

This is an example of how I use git to manage markdown files all via bash

I can easily move to another workstation and OS. Then I can pickup where I left off transparently as if nothing happened.

I could also sync my ~/.bash_history via my network, if needed instead of ssh-ing to the machine to peek into the file to lookup a complex ssh tunnel pipe I've forgotten the exact syntax to.

Since I also spawn all executable from the shell ever since the #c64 & #amiga computer era (Amiga CLI), I have a shell open whenever my workstation runs. In case of this #DAW it's 24/7


On servers and workstations I basically live in $bash


()#DAW -> digital audio workstation

This document is a *wip, work in progress* Its not finished yet. It is ripe for (prelimenary) publishing, which is the main reason why I released it.
