## The Goal

Achieve the mythical 24hour stream louwers
(without dying in the process).

### The Method
I've done 24hr streams, quite a few of them even.

There is a strict set of rules I abide by to keep myself healty:

- Run a cron scheduled task / reminder to **hydrate** my body in time every hour
- Run another cron synced task to remind me to take _bio-breaks_ every few hours
- Run **yacst** (yet another cron scheduled task) to remind me to go and **cook** _**a meal**_ for the house
- As last I run **yacst** to remind me to get up every few hrs, to _defocus_ and get the leg circulation up to par again.

Only when all those parameters are setup and _**verified**_ to run on the _linux_ workstation, with a ssh terminal running on the win64 streaming client, will I start the endeavour.

## Safeguards
My system is simple:

- Always check periodically how I feel, the moment I feel irritation not coming from the simulation or MMO, I get up and walk around on the balcony
- If anything like disyness occurs, the stream is put on **autopilot** and I attend to my body first, later on (or next day) I tell what happened


## Announcements
### Mastodont Twitter IRC

It is important that fans know such a big stream is coming. I make sure that all of them know using twitter as an outlet.

Since I stream for **me** I don't respond to reactions warning me of the length / dangers, instead I point to a post which I had up on a blog, which contains these methods.

I start the stream with something light (like a sim I know by heart, or simple tasks in #SWTOR on a given toon set.

Then I continue in a **dynamic manner** while I _keep it light and funny_

If I don't have fun at a certain point and that takes more than 3 mins, I announce, pause and do something else. Viewers tune in to see me having fun, so while I interact where possible, the fun **I have** is important.


Using this system,
- I go from simulation to simulation, then _pause_
- Switch to an MMORPG like **#SWTOR** _pause again_
- Go to a high speed racing sim _pause_
- And so forth


### Safeguard routines
The moment I feel that I need a break, **I take it**. If I need to get up at once and leave the stream, I make sure the stream runs properly on auto (with broadcast quality music at 0dB) and I get up.
