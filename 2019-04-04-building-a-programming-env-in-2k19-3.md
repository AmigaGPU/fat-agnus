(*)Revision tracking via **git**

You know what the most important thing is when you make programming ENVs?

Consistency in workflow.

I want git to behave (almost) the same in #linux #win64 and #freeBSD. Luckily the coders of git (which is the brainchild of Linus Torvalds) made sure of that. All that you need to do is use _bash_ that came with it, for the easiest path to that achievement.

Another beautifull thing about tools is that even though, they can do a **lot** you only need to learn what _you_ need, to achieve your goals.

I know no person who knows everything there is about bash, probably only the original programmers and contributors do, and that is a _group_ of people, a collective.

I do know one person who know a _lot_ about different shells, but that is simply because she *had to* gain that knowledge, due to her programming ENV:

If you want to learn what she shared. I will link the site at the end of this doc with (*)
