Revision tracking added to **git**. This is how text editing should be controlled.


As I said the last time having a smooth programming **ENV:** is important when you want to program on whatever machine (on your network) you are on.

The reason is obvious. I want to be able to code in between work / play / stream sessions. Even tiny snips on 15mins to 30 mins are benificial to me.

One annoying problem of different cloud techs is that they want CC-info (think breaches, so I dont want that data spread everywhere) yet I have to learn 2 play with them somehow, at least those which give you a chance to.
#IBMCloud seems to play nice since they tell you what you can do on their network.

It may in the end be like the student licence from _ACAD_ but that one has the following benefits:

- fully functional software
- you may download everything, save all files
- literally the whole software suit at your disposal for three years, so you can study everything
- the only catch is printing, that will show that you used a student licence, which is quite fine, since you **can work** with the program suite

### AWS

With opensource cloud techs like **#AWS** you are not allowed to fully test their stuff. Those guys want CC info.

Amazon has the following benefits

- fairly good CC info protection
- you probably buy stuff there already so you have a card entered there also
- large network, lots of redundancy (good tech support?)


### The downside for users like me

1. impossible to test, for some reason it fails for me to activate #AWS
2. _**No testrun**_ of all means no way of learning how to use the cloudtech there.
3. opensource software effectively locked away behind a commercial veil.
4. Annoyance rises everytime I want to test it out ;)
