A post on reddit made me think of the chicken egg situation that 'new' streamers, who create for an audience, often have.

## Video

Many starting streamers dont have **important features** in a basic setup, suitable for the job.


One of them is a _secondary monitor_ to drop they stream's C&C (*) on.

### My C&C consists of:
- OBS prominently in center
- System monitor to have cpu / GPU loads of all processes textual and graphically displayed
- micro windows with time, date & network info with upload download bandwidth used
- Many MMO's dont have a time display option which you need to keep yourself hydrated

I would not have bought a new main monitor for streaming. In fact, I bought my IPS LED 1080p TV because my workflow just _needs_ a secondary screen.

### Monitor notes
Monitors should _not_ be bought anymore in this day & age. TV's are more than up to the task to display your GPU data properly. Both formats are digital for years now, so stop wasting money on monitors. With a TV you have a free ATSC receiver as a bonus.

For normal work the secondary monitor has proven vital with too many parameters to discuss here, but I would not go back to a programming ENV: which has just one.

My secondary monitor is connected to its own GPU, which I use to decode & transmit the stream out `nVEnc H264` to the relay networks, thus offloading the main GPU of that task.

Since many newbies start out with only one screen, chat is not visible for them, when they are full screen in a game.

Because of this an interaction conflict occurs:
* the streamer cant see the chat.
* viewer comes in choosing the channel out of the **millions** available
* viewer says hi, but gets no response, not even when the streamer is in rest
* viewer _leaves_ because he gets no interaction
* This results in the streamer drawing the conclusion that no one ever stays to watch his work.
* 

Many new streamers also did not setup (their)  channel bots at all. I have multiple channel bots not only protect the channel against trolls, but also log all in chat carefully.
I did this before I started streaming, because I also have experience with setting up and maintaining IRC channels.

Channel bot logs helped a lot in the single monitor setup. It helps now also when Im afk.

## Audio

One _crucial_ factor newbie streamers dont try to controll well is **audio** People dont care about medium quality video, but they get pissed at low quality sound.

I have a sound engineering background and know audio needs a **lot** of good equipment to be transmitted properly.

I needed:
- a 16 in 4 in 2 mixerboard (Yamaha) with build-in effects
- a multichannel compressor
- a headphone AMP from Behringer
- Shure SM58 mics
- Shure SRH440 headphones
- Behringer TH-03 professional studio headphones
- a Behringer headphone amp fed from one of the dual channel TS outputs on the console
