I was looked at in an odd way when I told my friends at the dawn of linux (alpha kernels on 386 DX machines) that this OS is **fascinating** and will make me money, sooner rather than later. A bold statement which proved to be true, soon after

### So I invested time in linux from that moment on.

A lot of time. like 2 to 4hrs a day, learning how to (cross) complile and build the OS, since no distros existed then.

All linux hackers were hardcore programmers who knew C and TurboPascal, fetched gcc for dos and made boot flops with `dd drive letter` from `c:\prg\src\linux\kernel\xcompile`

Exact syntax for command dd is in the **man-pages** (1)

Make sure you _don't_ make mistakes when using _dd_ you work as root and mistakes can be fatal for your whole drive!

All these years later I work in multiple OS'es (#freeBSD #Linux) stream in #win64 not wine/Linux since that is easier and can fix a problem with the best tools regardless of the OS they run in

(1)
Just type `man dd` in your terminal. Bash is often default, but **zsh** can be very nice to work with also.
