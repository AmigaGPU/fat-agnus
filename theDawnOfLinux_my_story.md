I was looked at in an odd way when I told my friends at the dawn of linux (alpha kernels on 386 DX machines) that this OS is **fascinating** and will make me money sooner than later.

## So I invested time in linux from that moment on.

A lot of time. like 4 to 8 hrs a day, learning how to cross complile and build the OS, since no distros existed then.

All linux hackers were hardcore programmers who knew C and TurboPascal, fetched gcc for dos and made boot flops with `dd drive letter` from `c:\prg\src\linux\kernel\xcompile`

All these years later I work in multiple OS'es (#freeBSD #Linux) stream in #win64 not wine/Linux since that is easier and can fix a problem with the best tools regardless of the OS they run in
