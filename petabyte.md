## To give you some indication of the grand scale**

- 1PetaByte = 1024TeraBytes
- => 1024 x 1024 GigaByte
- => 1048576 GigaByte for scale of the incredible ammount of raw unpartitioned unformatted platter space!!!

At 16TB // 14TB // 12TB per drive the ammount would be
- **1024 / 16 =  64 drives**
- **1024 / 14 =  74 drives**
- **1024 / 12 =  86 drives**
- **1024 / 08 = 128 drives!!!**
