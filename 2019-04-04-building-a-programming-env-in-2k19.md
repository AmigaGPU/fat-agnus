Also tracking this file with **git** revision power...

I've had to do this quite a few times, the past couple of months. Rebuild my programming ENV: on the #DAW where I spend most of my computing time on.

Since the machine also dubs as a streaming workstation, it is most of the times in a #win64 OS, even though per default it boots in #Linux (MX-Linux for a while now)

Now in the beginning I would scoff at building the ENV: in win64, the reality is that this machine is the one with the most RAM: we all know coding needs ram. The upgrade of this #DAW will also be 32GB later 64GB on a 2700X CPU sporting the same hardware for the rest.

Since I really needed to code more, I just hacked the button (literal from de knoop doorhakken in NL) and started in win7 to build the ENV

Amazing how the age of that OS was shown; not even single docker possible.
I went to win8.1 for various reasons and tried again. Still a failure. I read the docs but wanted to see if I was smarter and could fake win10, as a joke.


I then left #docker alone and went for the other key elements 1st:
- git: that gave me the powerfull bash, newer than the old install of mingw
- vim: luckily included with git
- MarkDownEdit for obvious reasons
- golang: easily installed and nice to learn
- nodejs: just need 2 learn that too
- python v2.7.x I need SimpleHTTPServer
- RubyStack neatly integrated package
- scoop: to get neat tool install from the bash line
- vscode: just too good an IDE to play in
- unreal engine: yeah I love gaming IDE's also


All these installed without a problem. Actually no, the RubyStack always hicked up at the end when it needed to do the samples. But it worked and I have PostgreSQL and PhpMyAdmin as a few examples in a nice package with ruby and other important tools.

I have a nice tweet series about this in the #301daysofcode #100DaysOfCode #Linux #advancedprogramming hashtags on twitter.

This is a middle part of it: <https://twitter.com/Radio_Azureus/status/1109157486710439937>


This is part-I of the series in which I will publish this thread
