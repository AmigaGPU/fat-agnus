Earplugs & earbuds are _dangerous_ for your hearing. They sit way too close to the eardrums(*).

I use a bluetooth linked 40cm long **soundbar**, which has a SPL(**) of about 80dB. I store it in my backpack. It has 18650 batteries in it, which have enough juice for all I need for mobile listening.

The android phone plays vorbis encoded audio

THere is no option for me on the questionaire since I listen to music, _extensively_ even, while training, but only through a safe speaker system.

I listen to music I want to play for my internet streaming on #mixer & #twitch

 Ear pain indicates lower volumes are needed and / or soundsources need to be moved away from the ears. With headphones & earbuds it means lowering the volume a lot.
